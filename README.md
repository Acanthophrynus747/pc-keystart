novelty keystart power button for a PC. WIP.

A simple program for a tiny microcontroller (probably ATTiny85) to light up LEDs in sequence as a keystart switch is held and then eventually short the power button connection of my PC's motherboard after 3 seconds or so. I may look into having it make a sound or something cool like that. Perhaps in the future a version that could be wireless with an esp32 or something (connecting to a receiver inside the case) could be cool. But that might be more effort than this idea is worth.
