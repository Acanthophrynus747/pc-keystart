novelty keystart power button for a PC. WIP.

A simple program for a tiny microcontroller (probably ATTiny85) to light up LEDs in sequence as a keystart switch is held and then eventually short the power button connection of my PC's motherboard after 3 seconds or so. I may look into having it make a sound or something cool like that. Perhaps in the future a version that could be wireless with an esp32 or something (connecting to a receiver inside the case) could be cool. But that might be more effort than this idea is worth. 

key switch I am currently using: https://www.amazon.com/APIELE-Position-Switch-Momentary-XB2-10Y/dp/B088PR9LSL?pd_rd_w=0NXRd&content-id=amzn1.sym.679481c3-2bf4-4843-80c0-ffb319282e84%3Aamzn1.symc.c3d5766d-b606-46b8-ab07-1d9d1da0638a&pf_rd_p=679481c3-2bf4-4843-80c0-ffb319282e84&pf_rd_r=4XGYW3G1YWS1MQC4SMFB&pd_rd_wg=t7Lem&pd_rd_r=f6415832-4f6e-4a19-85f1-092bd3d7d97f&pd_rd_i=B088PR9LSL
